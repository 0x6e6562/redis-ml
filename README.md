The stored models are fully operational and support performing the prediction/evaluation.

Redis-ML is a turn key solution for using trained models in a production environment. Allowing loading ML models from any platform immediately ready to serve.

The module includes these primary features:

* Decision Tree ensembles (random forests) classification and regression
* Linear regression
* Logistic regression
* Matrix operations
